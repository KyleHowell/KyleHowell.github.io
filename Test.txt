backbone
leaflet - simple maps (most projects)
openlayers - more overhead, mor powerful, complex
d3 - sattelite visualization, patterns

3 teams - spacecraft, mission control, imagery(this)
problems:
  - volume of data (buy amazon server time)
  - color correction(blue) USE MOTUS? DATA - unreliable

- tiny apps, adding new features
- dashboards, API graphing data (d3?, charts.js?)
  - how much do we spend on amazon servers
    - Ec2 amazon standard offerings, username how did i spend this month?
    - s3, storage systems

haskell - functional programming

- WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.[2] WebGL is integrated completely into all the web standards of the browser allowing GPU accelerated usage of physics and image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas.

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

OpenLayers is an open source (provided under the 2-clause BSD License[2]) JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers. It provides an API for building rich web-based geographic applications similar to Google Maps and Bing Maps.

Leaflet is a widely used open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. First released in 2011,[2] it supports most mobile and desktop platforms, supporting HTML5 and CSS3. Alongside OpenLayers, and the Google Maps API it is one of the most popular JavaScript mapping libraries, and is now used by major web sites such as FourSquare, Pinterest and Flickr.

The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap and does not have a built-in scene graph.

The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is an international network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government packet switched networks, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.
