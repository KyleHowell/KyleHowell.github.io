ReddyReader
ReddyReader is a site that provides feedback and analysis on your reading speed. We are solving the question: "How long will it take for me to read this book?" We administer a speed reading test and then calculate how long it will take to read that book. This site was created with a group of graduates from Dev Bootcamp. My role in the project was to create a rich user experience. Users of the site not only find out how long it will take to read a book, but will also be able to buy that book directly.
ReddyReader is a 'rails as an API' back-end with a Javascript-heavy front-end deployed to Heroku via Circle CI, utilizing a number of APIs, technologies and frameworks, including Google Books, Goodreads OAuth, Amazon Product API, Chart JS, JQuery, Bootstrap and Mustache, implemented via TDD with RSpec, Capybara and Jasmine.

Let's Party!
Let's Party is a site which allows users to place pins on a map of San Francisco of free events in the city. Users can then text a number to find out how far away they are from those events.
This project allowed me to interact with the Google Maps API as well as experiment with Twilio to send text messages using data from the site.
