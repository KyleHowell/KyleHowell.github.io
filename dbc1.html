<h1><b>About me!</b></h1>
<p>I am very new to the realm of programming. I graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara with an Economics degree in 2010. Since then I have been taking part-time classes at my local community college to start a new degree in Computer Engineering. Eventually, this led me to DevBootcamp and I am completely focused on learning as much as I can!
</p>
<h2><i>Learning Objectives</i></h2>
<p>I plan to take in as much information as I can in this short amount of time that we have. Even completing the projects this week has taken all of my time this week! I am going at a very slow pace, being sure to understand as much as I can.</p>
