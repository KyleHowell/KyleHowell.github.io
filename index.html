<h2>About Me</h2>
<div id="im"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YING3Or.png?1"></div>
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Kyle Howell and I am very new to the field of computer engineering. My goal is to learn as much as I can and constantly improve my skills as a designer and programmer. I graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara with an Economics degree in 2010, and since then I have been trying to absorb as much information about computer programming. DevBootcamp will help me to achieve the goal of becoming a knowledgable programmer. </p>
<p>I have no previous experience in web design! This page is a work in progress and I am never satisfied by the way it looks. I will continue to improve the design as I learn more and update this site with my new projects. I would love for you to <a href="mailto:mrkylehowell@gmail.com">EMAIL ME</a> with suggestions on how to improve this website!</p>
