<h2>Reflecting on how I deal with conflict</h2>
<p>This week's blog will be about conflict. How do I deal with conflict? We have been introduced to a concept known as the<A HREF="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">"Compass of Shame" by Harold Grossman.</A> According to this theory, when we are confronted by shame, there are 4 different ways we can respond to this shame. At the north end is withdrawal which is to isolate yourself from the problem or running away from the problem. The south end is avoidance of the problem either by denial or by distraction through thrill-seeking or abusing drugs and alcohol. The East end is to attack yourself by putting yourself down. The final west end of the compass is to attack others by placing the blame on someone else or by lashing out verbally or physically. </p>

<p>The last time I dealt with conflict was at work. I work in the restaurant industry as a server and bartender, and there is always conflict between workers. Working with the same people day after day in a stressful enviornment leads to times where someone might lose their cool and create conflict with another coworker. I had a conflict with one of my other workers while bartending. As a bartender, not only do I have to take care of the guests at my bar, I also have to make drinks for everyone else in the restaurant. This often leads to times where other workers are waiting on me before they can take care of their own work. I would constantly have problems with a certain worker who would get impatient with how I would focus on my guests instead of making the drinks for his tables. He would constantly ask if his drinks were ready or how long they were going to take. In my mind, he was being impatient while in his mind he thought I was ignorning a certain part of my job.</p>

<p>Relating this to the compass of shame, I tend to deal with conflict through withdrawal. When that coworker would start to become impatient I would withdrawal from the problem by focusing on my job rather than deal with the conflict. I handled the problem by simply running away from the problem. Day after day, I could feel the tension between us growing. One day, he could not take it any longer and decided to yell across the bar while I was taking care of one of my guests, swearing loudly and complaing that his drinks were taking too long to be made. Obviously, swearing and yelling in front of our guests is a huge problem and I decided to instead attack him by placing the blame on him, yelling and blaming him for starting the situation.</p>

<p>My actions did not help the problem, it only made it worse! It took a long time before we were comfortable working with each other again. In retrospect, there is definately a better way to handle that situation. Instead of running from the problem in the first place, I should of acknowledged that he was waiting for me and let him know that his drinks will be coming out shortly. By ignoring and eventually attacking others, I only created more conflict.</p>

<p>How do you deal with conflict? I tend to withdrawal, while other people like my coworker may tend to attack others. It is important to take a step back and realize which direction on the compass you take when dealing with a difficult situation.</p>
