Happiness and Values
</header>

<p>What values come to mind when you are happiest?</p>

<p><div id="code">
Accomplishment Achievement Ambition Challenge Commitment Compassion Confidence Control Cooperation Courage Creativity Decisiveness Enthusiasm Excellence Excitement Faith Freedom Friendship Growth Knowledge Loyalty Responsibility Self-reliance Wisdom
</div></p>

<p>For me, I have been the happiest when my enthusiasm is the highest. I love to be completely focused on one project and devote all of my attention to it. When I find something that I enjoy, whether it be a new activity, or a new book I am happiest when I devote my full attention to it.</p>

<p>I often find struggle when I fail to life up to my values listed about. I especially lose the ambition and enthusiasm when approaching a difficult subject. In general, I would agree what I live up to these values.</p>
