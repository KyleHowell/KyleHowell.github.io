<p> Javascript has become increasingly popular with web designers for its ability to create dynamic, interactive, and accessible websites. Specifically, HTML 5 added an even greater importance for the use of Javascript. Javascript not only allows designers to create an animation, game, or graphic tool to supplement the HTML coding, but helps desiners use some of the newest features of HTML 5. The WebGL library, for instance, adds a real-time 3d graphics engine inside a HTML 5 page. There is also HTML 5 geolocation which allows designers to write applications that are aware of their location in the browser. Perhaps the biggest reason for the rise in popularity of Java is its ability to interact the the HTML code. Javascript allows developers to interact with the DOM and CSS models in a website allowing fo real-time changes to their website using Javascript functions. Javascript also is vital for helping to make a website compatable across multiple browsers and devices. </p>

<p> Above all else, the language is realatively simple to learn and start using right away. Manipulating websites through the browser console interacting with the DOM only takes a few simple Javascript commands to start using. Javascript is the language link that connects HTML and CSS together. It is no surprise we learned Java right after HTML and CSS! </p>

<p> Javascript does have its limitations, however. It simply cannot do everything that a web developer needs. Javascript cannot use printers or other devices on a user's system and it cannot directly access files on their systems. But perhaps the biggest limitation is that a user can simply disable Java, Javascript, or both! Most broswers have a simple command to disable Javascipt on a page. Designers use Java applets to make their pages more dynamic, but users can simply disable them. </p>
