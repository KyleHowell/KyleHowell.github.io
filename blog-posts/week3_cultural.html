<p>I learned that my Gregorc thinking style is heavily Concrete Sequential. I like order, logical sequence, following clear directions, and getting facts. Learning this came as somewhat of a shock to me. Although a can agree with my preference for clear directions, my learning enviornment has always been somewhat cluttered and my thought processes have not always been clear and directed. Although one person can have qualities of all types of these thinking styles, it was unexpected to me that I was so heavily placed in this category. This creates some unique strategies I can focus on to maximize my learning potential. </p>

<p>Firstly, my ordering ability favors sequential, step-by-step linear progression. I can facilitate this by creating specific goals for me to accomplish when I am taking on the week's work. I have started to create goals for what I want to accomplish every time I start working. If I get off track, I can come back to those goals that I set for myself to help me focus. </p>

<p>Secondly, my thinking process is instinctive, methodical, deliberate, and structured. I can definately agree with this! When faced with a topic I do not know much about, I go about learning that topic in an orderly fashion by taking new information and seeing how I can relate that information to what I have learned so far. I can change my study strategies by allowing myself to come to a comfortable understanding of a subject before I continue on with my work. At first I thought I was wasting time or getting off-topic by continuing to ressearch an idea that I was unfamiliar with, especially in the first two weeks of prep. However, this is just the way my mind works! I don't allow myself to continue on unless I have a comfortable understanding of what I need to do. Understanding this will be very helpful going forward.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that although my thinking style is heavily concrete seqential, it would be extremely beneficial for me to "challenge" my thinking style in ways to get me to approach a problem from a different perspective. The idea behind a growth vs. fixed mindset is that we a capable of making changes to the way we think by simply challenging these predispositions. It would be extremely beneficial for me to try and think more creatively in a non-linear fashion when approaching the prep work. Learning to think this way will help to get past problems that may have gotten me stuck if I approached them in a linear fashion. I need to learn to look past the problem and realise that there is always multiple ways to find the same solution. </p>
