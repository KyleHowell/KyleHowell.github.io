Stereotype Threat?
</header>

<p>This week I have done reaserch on the  <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Whistling-Vivaldi-Stereotypes-Affect-Issues/dp/0393339726">"Stereotype Threat" theory presented by Claude M. Steele.</A> Overall, Stereotype threat is the fear of someone confirming a negative stereotype about their particular group. This effect was tested <A HREF="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_steele_aronson.html">"in a 1995 study by Steele and Aronson.</A> In this test, they studied how well African American and White students performed on a difficult verbal exam under two conditions. One group was told this test was a measure of their intellectual ability and the other was told that this test did not measure anything. Under the first condition, African American students performed worse than their White counterparts when they were told this test compares them to each other. In this case the African American students might have feared the possibility of confirming a negetive stereotype about their intelligence. Without this fear, all students performed the same reguardless of race. </p>

<p>All of us belong to groups. We are all member of groups which negative stereotpyes exist. I am a white male, and with that comes negative stereotypes. For example, white males have a negative stereotype of being bad dancers. This theory might explain my bad dancing as confirming this stereotype. Perhaps the fear of confirming the belief that I am a bad dancer simply because I am white causes me to dance bad. This may not be the best example of this effect, but the fact that these identities and stereotypes exist may influence someone's performance is a profound theory. Maybe I have an excuse why I'm such a bad dancer?</p>
