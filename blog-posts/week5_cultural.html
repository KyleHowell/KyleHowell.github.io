Pairing and Giving Feedback
</header>

<p>For the last few weeks, I have been pair programming with other people using video chat to complete coding assignments together. Getting past the technical boundaries can be challenging. Learing how navigate through countless open windows becomes tough to manage when you have your have open the video chat, the command line, text editor, the file itself, and browser windows. At first it seems that using all this technology is just a waste of time, it would be much easier to do this in person or by yourself. But once I got comfortable with using all of these programs I really started to see the benefits of pair programming. This week I was stuck on the last challenge. I had trouble interpreting the code and knowing where to start. I paired with another person and we were able to get through the problem much easier together. I can see why DBC places such importance on pair programming, I can already see the results.

<p>Another part of pairing is learning from feedback. I cam very new to all of these subjects so my biggest fear is not being able to contribute immediately since I do alot of researching while I am working. Until I am completely comfortable with a particual language I will continue to work this way since I want to make sure I am not making mistakes. That can sometimes come across as I am not paying complete attention but I want to know what I am doing will work. Based on the feedback I have gotten, some of my initial fears of being slightly unfamiliar with syntax when coding have been confirmed and I really need to focus more on proper syntax. Even when writing new programs, I usually run into errors and need to change little things to get the code to run properly. I know that if I keep working these errors will happen less frequently. </p>

<p>I find it very tough to leave feedback for other people. Pairing to me is both of us contributing to the project and using both of our skills together. I find it tough to then leave feedback saying on how to improve. Since I am new to the subject, I don't feel qualified enough telling other people how they can improve.</p>

<p>Overall, pairing for me has been a great way to accomplish these tasks when I would have gotten stuck by myself. After pairing, learning from feedback is important but I find it hard to leave actionable feedback myself.</p>
