<p> I very much enjoied watching Shereef's Fireside Chat. It really helped ease some of the fears I have been having so far about DevBootcmap. I think I will very much enjoy the DevBootcamp experience. I love how it places such a strong emphasis on individual effort rather than learning from what the teachers tell you. I believe I will thrive in such a culture. Reflecting back on this week alone, since working with HTML is new to me, I took these projects very slow and was sure to absorb as much information as I could. Almost every time I was working on this week's work, I would find myself going too far down the 'rabbit hole' as Shereef mentioned in the video. That is because I really want to become an expert in HTML. I know that this will not happen overnight, but I really want to push myself as far as I can and it was hard for me to focus back on the work I had to accomplish when I was so engaged in reading this new material. I really want to be like a sponge and absorb as much as I can in this phase leading up to the start of the actual program. I have always wanted to learn HTML as well as other computing languages but I simply did not know where to start. I love how the DevBootcamp approach really let me learn things my own way, but simply gave me guidelines on what to do.</p>

<p> My expectations fot DevBootcamp has not changed much. I have always approached this program as my best chance to better myself and learn the information I needed to make myself a developer people would want to work for them. The end goal here is not to get a great job in this field. I want to become a programmer who is comfortable enough with these languages to create something unique from nothing. I believe I am well on my way to doing so. Looking back just a couple of days, I am very proud of what I have learned so far and I know that this is only the beginning. I am already impressed by much new information I have taken in and used that to create something that is my own.

<p> I am very excited to participate in this type of learning enviornment. I really agree with Shereef's metaphor comparing the restaurant verses the kitchen enviornment. I know I am guilty myself of having the restaurant mindset as I progressed through High School and even into college. Since I really did not know what I wanted to accomplish in my youth, I did not have the drive or passion to apply myself fully to new concepts and create something from scratch. In the years leading up to DevBootcamp, I have really had time to reflect on what I really want to accompish in life, and I know DevBootcamp can help get me there. I know that it will take alot of hard work, but I know I have the right mindset going into this program and I will succeed.
