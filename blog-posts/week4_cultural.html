<h2>Exploring the lack of diversity in the tech world</h2>

<p>Companies like Google, Yahoo, and Facebook have had a global impact and owe everything to their workers. However, investigating the diversity of that workforce produces startling results. While some may be more diverse than others. All of them are extremely skewed male, white and asain. A few months ago, Google released their diversity data and admitted that they're <A HREF="http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html">not where we want to be when it comes to diversity.</A> Google's tech employees are 83% male , a staggering number considering women make up 46.8% of the national workforce. Sorting by ethnicity, 60% are White and 30% are Asian. What can be done to fix this tremendous imbalance? My theory is that jobs in that industry are simply not thought of as options for a large percentage of potential workers. Simply getting the information out there, especially at a yonger age, that this is a rewarding and fulfilling profession will over time create a more representative workforce. Google has recently tried to be proactive about its diversity problem, <A HREF="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/22/google-invests-50-million-in-made-with-code-program-to-get-girls-excited-about-cs/">investing 50 million dollars in an intiative to get women more involved,</A> and hopefully more programs will emerge that create more excitement in this job field.
</br>
Since Google has released their diversity statistics, other tech companies have followed suit. This week, <A HREF="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/06/26/325798198/facebooks-diversity-numbers-are-out-and-theyre-what-you-expect">Facebook released their diversity statistics and it is more of the same result</A>. Facebook's tech employees are 85% male. Grouping by ethnicity, Facebook's tech employees are 53% White and 41% Asian. The following image shows how Google, Facebook and Yahoo's diversity statistics compare.</p>

<p>Overall, every company is starting to admit that they have a problem, which is a step in the right direction. Before you can fix a problem, you must first admit that you have one. I have an optimistic view that the reason the statistics are this way is because technology is such a new and developing field that it is just not considered as a job option for many people. Simply spreading this information will help to fix the problem.</p>
