<p> The first site I chose to analyse was NYtimes.com. This site is very easy on the eyes. It has almost a calming feel to the front page. There is no color used except for the photos used to supplement the articles. Italics and bold are used on the news articles, and even though the font size is very large the Headlines are not overpowering. Your eyes are first drawn to the color photos, then to the multiple headlines, then to the headlines that catch your attention. Lastly, you eyes are drawn to the short descriptions of the articles. It is very easy to scroll through the content of the site without straining your eyes. </p>

<p>The second site I chose to analyze was ESPN.com. Compared with Nytimes, the front page uses bold and bright colors to catch your attention. While Nytimes had a calming feel to the page, the ESPN front page caught your attention right away, especially the story they chose to illuminate on the front page. Your eyes are immediatly drawn to the 'headline of the night' and after a few seconds a video starts to play. It is hard not to have your full attention on the main article and the video. There are a number of other articles to click on, but they are in a much smaller font and are placed off to the side. You would only pay attention to these articles after being drawn to the one story they chose to highlight.

<p> The last site I chose to highlight was Google.com. Compared with the other site, Google has a very minimalist front page. I use google for a number of things including email and their search engine. The minimalist approach with a white background and limited use of color in the Google banner have a very calming effect. Perhaps this is why I chose to have google.com as my front page, it is not very flashy and unobtrusive. You can access other options including their email service and their social networking platform from a small margin at the top right hand of the page, but those options are so small that you might not notice them at first glace.
