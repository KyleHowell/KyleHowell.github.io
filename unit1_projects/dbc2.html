<h2>Descriptions</h2>
<p>San Francisco is one of the easiest cities in the world to get around without a car. Take it from me, I have lived here for three years now and and finally starting to figure out all of the excellent resources this city has to offer.</p>

<p><strong>Quicky</strong> is an Android based app that gives you up to the minute information when bus and muni lines will be approaching! </p>

<p><strong>Lyft</strong> is a ride-share program. After signing up, users can request for a driver to pick them up. This is very similar to a taxi service, but no money is exchanged inside the car. All payments, and well as tips are paid through the app. It is much cheaper than calling a taxi! When you do not have time to use Muni, Lyft can take you where you need to go fast.</p>

<p><strong>Uber</strong> is another ride share program similar to Lyft with a much larger service radius that extends South of downtown San Francisco.</p>

<p><strong>BART</strong> is an underground rail system that connects San Francisco to Berkeley on the other side of the Bay Bridge. BART also connects to both Oakland and San Francisco International airport. Bart has limited stops in downtown San francisco however. Refer to this <A HREF="https://www.bart.gov/stations"><span style="color:white">Map</span></A> to see where the stops are located.</p>
