<h3>
<ul>
<li>Color: I really want to use this awesome photo I found of San Francisco as my background in my template. That creates some unique challenges with color. I want to have text clearly appear on the page. I want to change the color of the box surrounding the text so the text pops out no matter if it is in a dark or light portion of the background.</li>
<li>Sections: My sections are currently nonexistant I want clearly defined spaces on my page. I want to add a column and an aside. Reference my wireframe sketch for the full design plan</li>
<li>Pictures: While the background is awesome, I want to add a couple more photos to my template to spice up the page a bit.</li>
<li>Removing Negative Space: The borders aound my text take up too much room. I want to have all text have a box around them that disguinguises them from the background, but have the box take up as little space as possible and not extend to the whole screen.</li>
</ul>
