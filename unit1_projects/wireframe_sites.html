<p> The first website I will analyze is NyTimes.com. This website is trying to solve the problem of communicating today's news to its readers. This brings forth a number of visual challenges. The first is not to overwhelm the viewer with too much information. They do a great job of this with the limited use of color. The only color you can see on the front page is the color photo they used to highlight the front page story. This draws your eyes immediately to the photo, and then to the headline which is the second largest font on the page beside the name of the newspaper at the top. By only using black and white the viewer is not overwhelmed by the number of articles they have the option of clicking on and then reading. The second visual challenge is to highlight the main news stories of the day. They do a great job of this by putting the articles in bold to draw your eyes to the article, but adding italics seems to make the use of bold less intrusive. Only the main articles of the day are in larger font type, while subsequest articles are in smaller and smaller font type. Overall, this website accomplished their goals with clever use of color and font styling. The wireframe reaveals very clean and organized columns with information which helps to accomplish their goal of not overwhelming the user.</p>

<p> The second website I will analyze is ESPN.com. This website is trying to solve the problem of communicating the most important sports-related news stories of the day. Comparing this site to NYTimes, there is so much color that your eyes are drawn all over the page. This is probably because this site has to accomplish the goal of providing news for a number of different sports. Users from all around the world have different needs from this site, some just want to see their particular sport or team that they find interesting while some just want to see the main stories of the day. This creates an incredible visual challenge for the designers and they accomplished this goal by using color all over the page. Your eyes are not just drawn to the main story that they chose to highlight, but instead your eyes are drawn all over the page to the many things they chose to highlight. At the very top is a banner which is in the same black background with white color that the main story of the day is displayed in. This is a clever way to allow the viewer to navigate away from the main page if they are not interested in the stories on the front page. Since they are in the same color scheme, they seem connected. Overall, since this page has such a wide audience with diffent reasons to come to the site, overwheming the page with color while also connecting the navigation bar with creative color usage use allow this site to accomplish its goals. The wireframe reveals the many number of boxes and pictures of different shapes and sizes which may overwhelm the user without their use of color.

<p> The last site I will analyse is Google.com. The main problem this website is providing the best seach engine, but also providing a number of other resources including social networking, email, advertising and maps. This creates an immense visual challenge. Google prides itself on having the least-intrusive of search engines but they have expanded their market into other services that they want to provide. They must stay minimalist while also trying to expand their website into almost countless other services. They do this by creatively not using much color at all on their homepage. The website is almost completely white at first glace. Your eyes are immediately drawn to the Google logo, and then to the simple search bar right below that. Your eyes almost completely miss the other options on this page besides the search engine. However the wireframe shows that there is much more to this site than that. The top right of the screen allows the user to naviagate to any of their other services, while the bar the the bottom left of the screen allows for advertisers to contact them. The wireframe reveals a much more complex website than what you may first expect at first glance.
